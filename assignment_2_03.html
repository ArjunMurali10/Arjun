        It involves designing, coding, and maintaining websites. Learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** 
        is essential for becoming a skilled web developer. The rise of **responsive design** has made 
        websites accessible across different devices. Understanding frameworks like Bootstrap and React

    <h2>The Importance of Learning CSS</h2>
    <p>
        **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is crucial for making web pages visually appealing. It allows 
        developers to control **colors, layouts, fonts, and responsiveness**. Using **external CSS files** 
        ensures better organization and reusability of styles. The **universal selector (`*`)** helps 
        apply global styles to all elements, making design consistency easier.
